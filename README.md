## Description

Using the starter code for and the given database data. I completed the 4 models and set the requirements for each one as well. Also adding association between those sequilize models as well. It was good practice working with mysql and building on that with sequilize. I also had to complete the routes for each item and I tested them using insomnia.

## Usage

Source db/schema.sql will create the database and seed with npm run seed. Running npm start will start the server and and the routes can be checked with the browser on insomnia.
